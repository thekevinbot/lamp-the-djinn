"""Provider env injection: wiring whatever runs *inside* the cage to the proxy.

A "harness" is the agent program executed in the sandboxed devcontainer (Claude
Code, Codex, Aider, or any arbitrary command the user types). lamp-the-djinn is
harness-agnostic: it does not maintain a registry of known agents. The command
is whatever the user passes through on the CLI; this module's only job is to
hand that command the env vars it needs to reach the LiteLLM proxy on the host.

Provider seam
-------------
Every harness talks to ONE local endpoint -- the LiteLLM proxy -- never to a
provider directly. The proxy abstracts away *which* backend serves a request:
``--model local`` may hit llama.cpp on a local box, while ``--model glm-5.2``
fans out to OpenRouter. The harness neither knows nor cares; it only sees a
base URL and an API key.

Because the command is arbitrary, we cannot know in advance whether it speaks
the OpenAI chat-completions wire format or the Anthropic Messages format. So we
inject BOTH provider families and let the harness pick up whichever it reads:

* OpenAI family (Codex, Aider, custom): ``OPENAI_BASE_URL``, ``OPENAI_API_KEY``,
  ``OPENAI_MODEL`` -- pointed at the proxy's ``/v1`` (OpenAI-format) endpoint.
* Anthropic family (Claude Code): ``ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL``,
  ``ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN``, ``ANTHROPIC_MODEL``.

NOTE on ``ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL``: Claude Code's native ``/v1/messages`` calls
speak the Anthropic Messages format, which LiteLLM exposes on its
*anthropic-format* passthrough endpoint. That endpoint may live at a DIFFERENT
path than the ``/v1`` OpenAI-compatible one. We default ``ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL``
to the same proxy URL for convenience, but allow an explicit override via the
``LTD_ANTHROPIC_PROXY_URL`` env var when LiteLLM's anthropic path differs.

    The Anthropic base URL defaults to ``proxy_url`` but honors an
